    Fox is awesome because they have a <em>orange and white long fur. </em>
        Foxes are small-to-medium-sized omnivores mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. 
        They have a flattened skull; upright, triangular ears; a pointed, slightly upturned snout; 
        and a long, bushy tail.

    <p id="fox-poem">
      Watch the fox gallop the silver line,<br>
      He is not yours he is not mine,<br>
      A wild beast to freely roam,<br>
      On your wrist he finds his home
    </p>
    
   <p class="second-poem-about-fox">
    Twas Autumn and the trees ablaze,<br>
    With colours rust and brown,<br>
    The fox asleep in bracken snug,<br>
    Lived just outside the town.<br>
    No baying hounds, no braying men<br>
    On horseback sought him there<br>
    Old Reynard free from such as these<br>
    Slept soundly without care.<br>
    </p> 
    
    <p class="second-poem-about-fox">
    A passing artist spied him and<br>
    The russet blaze espied<br>
    “A copper fox! A copper fox!” excitedly she cried.<br>
    The fox was startled and soon fled<br>
    His image , though, was captured,<br>
    In copper tones, around her wrist,<br>
    Its wearer quite enraptured.<br>
